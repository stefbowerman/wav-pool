Users who apply for permission to download Tracks from the Website – the application consists of a handful of questions regarding identity and intended use – may, if approved, download various Tracks to their individual Dropbox accounts. (The downloading is automated by the Website, which also creates a designated folder in the user’s Dropbox account to store the downloaded Tracks.)</p>
        <p>The Website collects a minimal amount of personal information regarding each user, discussed further below. Also, as discussed below and noted above, the Website does not grant you any license to use the Music beyond the right to stream or, if granted, download the music for personal or evaluative use. Under no condition may you make any public or commercial use of the Music without a separate, negotiated license from AWM.</p>
        <h4>Sign in with Dropbox</h4>
        <p>To enable features beyond streaming – marking and storing favorites, and downloading Tracks (the “Dropbox Features”) – you must sign in with your Dropbox account.

AWM disclaims all liability regarding your use of the Dropbox Features.</p>

        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>If you sign in with Dropbox, AWM logs your name, email address, what Tracks you download and when you download them. No other personal information is collected or stored by AWM or even accessible to AWM in relation to the Dropbox Features. AWM encourages users to review Dropbox, Inc.’s Privacy Policy to determine how, if at all, your privacy may be impacted by Dropbox through your use of the Dropbox Features.</p>
        <p>AWM does not monitor your personal usage of the Website or collect any of your personal information if you do not sign in with Dropbox. AWM does use various analytic services to collect data, including page views, play counts, favorites, search queries and other metrics, but such data is kept anonymous.</p>
        <h4>Extremely Limited License</h4>
