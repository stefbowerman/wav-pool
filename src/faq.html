        <h6>Why do I need to license music?</h6>
        <p>If you are including music in your production, it needs to be cleared for use by the copyright owner or it’s administrators. Generally we charge a fee for each music license based on it’s use, especially for commercially marketed, or promoted productions. Drop us a line so we can quote you a price based on what type of production the song is going to be used for.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>I am in need of a song, where can I listen to the tracks you have available for use?</h6>
        <p>You can go to the <a href="/catalog">Catalog</a> section of the website.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>How much are the licensing fees?</h6>
        <p>Each of your projects is one of a kind, so there are various factors that are considered when determining the fee for licensing a song. You should email us with the details of the project including the name of the company producing the project, where the project will be published (web, social, etc), and the song you would like to use. We do not currently have a standard rate card.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>I am looking for a song that sounds just like a song I heard on a commercial today, will you guys make it for me?</h6>
        <p>No, we are not a production house and we do not copy others work. We source music from real artists who spend a lot of time working on their art. Each song we have has an original sound.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>I am looking for a song that sounds like or has the same vibe as a song I heard today, can you send me something similar?</h6>
        <p>Yes, we can build you playlists based on your needs. Just let us know what you are looking for, drop us an email at info@wav-pool.com, with examples, links or a description.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>What kind of music do you have in your catalog?</h6>
        <p>While our foundation lies in the beat culture. We have many years experience as curators of every genre of popular music. We also dive deep into every subgenre of music old and new. We are experts in musical aesthetic. The music we include in our catalog are often variants or combinations of every kind of music known to human kind, but never trite and always original.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>I have a project that has no budget, will the artist be ok with only receiving song credits?</h6>
        <p>Sorry, we generally don’t license music for free. If you are an organization, or working on a project for a fundraiser for a special cause email us, and we’ll try to help. Otherwise it is not specifically our line of business to promote artists, rather to acquire sync fees for each use.</p>
