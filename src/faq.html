        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Q: Why do I need to license music?</h2>
        <p>A: If you are including music in your production, it needs to be cleared for use by the copyright owner or it’s administrators. Generally we charge a fee for each music license based on it’s use, especially for commercially marketed, or promoted productions. Drop us a line so we can quote you a price based on what type of production the song is going to be used for.</p>

        <h2>Q: I am in need of a song, where can I listen to the tracks you have available for use?</h2>
        <p>A: You can send us an email at info@electric-life.org requesting login credentials (user name and password). We will then assign, then email you the credentials. From there, you can login to the catalog, browse and download music in AIFF format.</p>

        <h2>Q: I am looking for a song that sounds just like a song I heard on a commercial today, will you guys make it for me?</h2>
        <p>A: No, we are not a production house and we do not copy others work. We source music from real artists who spend a lot of time working on their art. Each song we have has an original sound.</p>

        <h2>Q: I am looking for a song that sounds like or has the same vibe as a song I heard today, can you send me something similar?</h2>
        <p>A: Yes, we can build you playlists based on your needs. Just let us know what you are looking for, drop us an email at info@electric-life.org, with examples, links or a description.</p>

        <h2>Q: What kind of music do you have in your catalog?</h2>
        <p>A: Our foundation lies in the beat culture. The founders of the company have many years experience as curators of every off shoot of instrumental beat music. Some sound like electronic beats to rap over, and some sound like rock infused ambient jazz. We cover A LOT of genres, but the common thread is the beat, almost all of which is instrumental.</p>

        <h2>Q: I have a project that has no budget, will the artist be ok with only receiving song credits?</h2>
        <p>A: Sorry, we generally don’t license music for free. If you are an organization, or working on a project for a fundraiser for a special cause email us, and we’ll try to help. Otherwise it is not specifically our line of business to promote artists, rather to acquire sync fees for each use.</p>
